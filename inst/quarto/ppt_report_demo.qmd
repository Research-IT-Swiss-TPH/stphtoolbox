```{r}
library(ggplot2)
iris %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = stph_colors) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Pie chart

The iris dataset was used for this demo.

```{r}
as.data.frame(table(iris$Species)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = stph_colors) +
  theme_void()
