	abstract = {Immature anophelines inhabit aquatic environments with diverse physicochemical properties and microorganisms. In insectary settings, ammonia accumulation in larval rearing trays can lead to high larval mortality. Bacterial communities in these trays may influence ammonia levels through nitrification and denitrification. While symbiotic bacteria are known to be crucial for nutrition, digestion, reproduction, and immune responses in anophelines, the microbial communities specifically associated with Anopheles coluzzii larvae have not been characterised.Building on a study examining ammonia-capturing zeolite and water changes for rearing Anopheles coluzzii, this research characterised the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify species linked to larval survival and phenotypic quality. Functional filters were applied to identify bacteria related to ammonia nitrification and their impact on larval development. qPCR was used to validate the sequencing data for the 10 most significant bacteria. Water changes significantly reduced bacterial diversity and abundance, improving adult mosquito development and quality. In contrast, untreated trays showed a higher abundance of potentially harmful bacteria, adversely affecting development. Applying zeolite increased nitrifying bacteria presence, benefiting mosquito growth while lowering toxic bacteria levels—trends confirmed by qPCR.This study offers insights into the bacterial communities in mosquito larval-rearing water, highlighting species that could enhance ammonia nitrification and overall rearing success.},
